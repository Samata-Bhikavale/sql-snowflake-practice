# SQL Problem-Solving Project using Snowflake 🚀

In this project, I solved 15 SQL problems using **Snowflake** as the cloud platform. These problems were inspired by questions from the **Techtfq Masterclass** (which provided a great learning structure). I wrote, tested, and validated each solution independently to practice key SQL concepts.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Covered:
- **Filtering and conditional logic**
- **CASE statements**
- **Window functions** (e.g., `DENSE_RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`)
- **Aggregations and GROUP BY** clauses
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- **Subqueries and joins**

## 📚 Data and Questions:
- The questions and sample datasets were based on practical scenarios and designed to cover common SQL use cases in **Data Analysis** and **Data Engineering** roles.
- All queries were executed on **Snowflake**, and the solutions reflect my independent problem-solving approach.

## 🎯 Purpose:
- To solidify my SQL skills for future **Data Analyst** and **Data Science** roles.
- To practice SQL queries that involve complex logic and real-world scenarios.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies:
- **Snowflake** (SQL Editor)
- **SQL Queries** (MySQL dialect)

## ✅ Acknowledgements:
- Questions and datasets provided by the **Techtfq Masterclass**, which I followed to practice and improve my SQL skills.
- All solutions were solved independently by me.

## 📂 Project Files:
- `Question1.sql`: Query to solve problem 1
- `Question2.sql`: Query to solve problem 2
- … (and so on)

## 🎓 Learnings:
- Gained practical experience in solving analytical SQL queries on a cloud database.
- Enhanced my ability to apply SQL in **real-world data** scenarios.
- Developed an understanding of advanced SQL features such as **window functions**, **CTEs**, and **subqueries**.
